/**
 *
 * 一个接口用它的实现来定义请求跟处理对象的的映射关系
 * 即就是一次Http请求所对应的处理的方法。
 *
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not
 * necessary, as {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping}
 * and {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.RequestMappingHandlerMapping}
 * are included in the framework. The former is the default if no
 * HandlerMapping bean is registered in the application context.
 *
 * <p>HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not
 * have to.
 *
 * 一个Handler总是被封装成一个HandlerExecutetionChain实例，也可能伴随一些HandlerInterceptor实例。
 *
 * DispatcherServlet 将会先执行每个HandlerInterceptor的preHandler，
 * 然后等preHandler的所有方法都返回true的时候执行自己。
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <p>The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual
 * capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write
 * a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other
 * variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered}
 * interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting
 * applied by DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
